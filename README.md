# Flapdragon 

A simple Flappy Bird-inspired game written in Rust using `bracket-lib`. 

## About the Project
Flapdragon is a fun experiment in game development designed to showcase:
- Procedural obstacle generation.
- Responsive player controls.
- A clean and efficient Rust codebase.

This project gave me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of Rust, tackle real-time rendering challenges, and experiment with `bracket-lib` for game development.

## Features
- **Player Controls:** Spacebar flapping for precision gameplay.
- **Procedural Obstacles:** Randomly generated gaps and sizes based on the score.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Obstacle size shrinks as the score increases.
- **Classic Gameplay:** Inspired by the iconic mechanics of Flappy Bird.

## Running the Game
To play Flapdragon:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Rust and Cargo if you havenâ€™t already: [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
3. Run the game:
